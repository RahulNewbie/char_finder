Instruction:

Install collections and unittest. I used python 3.8 for the solution and followed PEP8 standards.

Description:

Solution has two python files. 

a) finder.py
b) test.py

finder.py is the main solution file. Here I have made a class named as Finder. It has a parameterised constructor and a function named as find(), as described in the problem description.

To run the the solution file, please use "python finder.py"

test.py is the unit tests for the Finder class.
